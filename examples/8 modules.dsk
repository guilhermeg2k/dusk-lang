### 
Every file must have a mod name at top of the file
Modules can be imported with the keyword use
When importing a module every public function, type or trait is imported
###

mod Name

use "std"

use (
    "std"
    "io"
)

let main = ()
  open("file.txt", "r")

### 
If are conflicting functions, types or treats  between modules
you can use "as" to create a namespace to the module
###

use "io" as "InputOutput"

let main = ()
  InputOutput.open("file.txt", "r")


### To mark a function, type or trait as public you can use the keyword "pub" ###

pub let add = (x,y: Number) => x+y
