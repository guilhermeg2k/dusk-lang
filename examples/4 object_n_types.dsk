###
Types can only have basic types and other types as fields
Which means it can't have functions 
To mark a field as optional you can use the ? operator
###

type Animal
  name: String
  age = 1
  race: String

let animal = Animal(
  name = "Dog",
)

echo(animal.name) # "Dog"
echo(animal.age) # 1
echo(animal.race) # null

###
Type Composition
When a type composes another type it gets all of its fields
and can be used as the composed type 
###

type Mammal
  ...Animal
  furColor: String

### Object initialization

### Inline
let dog = Mammal(name = "Dog", age=10, furColor="brown")

### Multi lines
let dog = Mammal(
  name = "Dog"
  age = 10
  furColor = "brown"
)

let screamAnimalName = (animal: Animal)
  echo(animal.name.toUpperCase())

screamAnimalName(dog) # "DOG"
