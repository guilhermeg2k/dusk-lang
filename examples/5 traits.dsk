### 
Traits are like interfaces in other languages. 
The main difference is that they can only have function signatures, not properties.

type Animal
  name: String
  age = 1

type Person
  firstName: String
  lastName: String

trait Eater
  eat: () => Void

Eater for Animal
  eat = () 
    echo("nom nom nom")

Eater for Person
  eat = () 
    echo("nhame nhame nhame")

let eat = (e: Eater) => e.eat()

let a = Animal("Bob")
let p = Person("John", "Doe")

eat(a) # nom nom nom
eat(p) # nhame nhame nhame
